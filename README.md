I'm John/SKULL a student who wants to get into the tech industy and since i am making projects for university I thought I would upload them here.
The course I am studing is Applied Computing but probbaly going to transfer to computer science after the first year. 
I've always loved computers and coding and also joined the club of building my own pc but now looking for more 'real life' work.
